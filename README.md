## Features

### Hiding Recommendations and Comments

The extension provides a distraction-free browsing experience by allowing you to hide YouTube recommendations and comments.

### Timeout Feature

To reduce the addictive nature of YouTube videos and shorts, the extension provides a timeout feature. It also helps in preventing you from endlessly scrolling YouTube shorts.

Need a break from the distraction blocker? The extension includes a break feature that allows you to temporarily disable the settings. 
During this break, you can study or simply chill out without the restrictions. You can also set custom break durations and configurations.
